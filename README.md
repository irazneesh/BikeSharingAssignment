## General Information
    A bike-sharing service provider, has experienced a significant decline in revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the company prepares for a post-pandemic recovery, they seek to understand the factors driving the demand for shared bikes. By predicting future demand, it aims to tailor their business strategy to maximize revenue and meet customer expectations once normalcy returns.
    
    The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts daily bike demand using a variety of independent variables. These variables include weather conditions, seasonal factors, and socio-economic conditions. The insights from this model will help it to:
        1. Identify significant factors that influence bike-sharing demand.
        2. Quantify the impact of each factor on bike demand.
        3. Develop data-driven strategies to capture market demand and outperform competitors in the post-pandemic scenario.
    
    The predictive model will enable service provider to understand demand dynamics in the market, allowing them to optimize operations, plan inventory, and make informed decisions on pricing and marketing strategies. This will position the company to effectively capture the anticipated surge in bike-sharing demand once the COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and the economy stabilizes.   



## Conclusions
The analysis indicates that bike rental demand is highly sensitive to both temporal factors and weather conditions:

1. Impact of Holidays: The statistically significant decrease in bike rentals on holidays suggests that people may prefer other forms of transportation or choose to stay home during these times. This could be due to fewer commuters or a general reduction in outdoor activities during holidays.

2. Seasonal Influence: The significant increase in bike rentals during fall and spring indicates that these seasons are more favorable for cycling, likely due to more comfortable weather conditions. The moderate temperatures and pleasant environment during these seasons seem to encourage more people to use bike-sharing services.

3. Monthly Trends: The increase in bike rentals specifically in August and September could be due to a combination of favorable weather and a return to regular routines after summer vacations. This period may also coincide with the start of the school year or the end of the summer holidays, leading to increased commuting and outdoor activities.

4. Weather Conditions - Wind Speed: The significant decrease in bike rentals with increasing wind speed suggests that windier conditions deter people from biking. High winds can make cycling more challenging and less safe, which likely discourages users from renting bikes.

5. Weather Conditions - General Weather: The decrease in bike rentals as the weather situation worsens indicates that adverse weather conditions, such as rain or extreme cold, have a negative impact on bike-sharing usage. Poor weather likely reduces the appeal and practicality of cycling, leading to fewer rentals.

Overall Implication:
Bike service provider  should consider these findings in their business strategy. For example, they could offer promotions or alternative services during holidays or bad weather to maintain revenue. Additionally, they might focus marketing efforts or increase bike availability during high-demand periods like fall, spring, and specific months like August and September.
